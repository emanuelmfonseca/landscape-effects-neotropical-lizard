# Genetic structure and landscape effects on gene flow in the Neotropical lizard Norops brasiliensis (Squamata: Dactyloidae)

This repository contains the scripts used to generate simulated datasets and compare them using convolutional neural network (CNN) from Fonseca et al. 2024 (Emanuel M. Fonseca, Nathaniel S. Pope, William E. Peterman, Fernanda P. Werneck, Guarino R. Colli, Bryan C. Carstens. Heredity).

The primary script employed for conducting simulations is located at `Scripts/Main_script.R`. Subsequently, the simulations were analyzed and compared utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) through the script found at `Scripts/CNN_scripts.py`. 

Before making them available, scripts were tested on a mac (Mac mini, 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 2 cores).
